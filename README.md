# HDR-compression
The course project for ELG5126 Source coding and data compression.  

Abstract:
Nowadays, a new image appearance model was developed for HDR (High-Dynamic-Range) image rendering, which is denoted iCAM06. This new model inherits the basic framework of iCAM model but also incorporates several improvements in order to preserve more detail information and enhance local contrast. iCAM06 combines the spatial processing models in the human visual system, photoreceptor light adaptation functionsand functions that predict a wide range ofcolor appearance phenomena.Ithas also been proved to be more suitable to adapt the Human Visual System in practically andtheoretically.
